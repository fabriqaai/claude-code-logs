# Project Constitution

> Universal policies that apply to ALL code in this project.
> This file is always inherited from root — modules cannot override it.

## Git Workflow

- **Commit Style**: Conventional commits (feat:, fix:, chore:, docs:, refactor:, test:)
- **Branch Strategy**: Feature branches merged via pull request
- **Main Branch**: `main` is always deployable — pushes trigger automated releases

## Code Review

- All changes require pull request review
- At least one approval required before merge
- No self-merging to main/master
- Security-sensitive changes require additional review

## CI/CD

- **Platform**: GitHub Actions
- **Test Command**: `go test -v ./...`
- **Release**: GoReleaser with Homebrew tap
- All PRs must pass CI checks before merge
- Automated tests run on every push
- Main branch pushes trigger automated version bump and release

## Security Policies

- **No secrets in code** — use environment variables or GitHub Secrets
- Dependencies must be from trusted sources (Go modules)
- Security vulnerabilities addressed promptly
- No credentials, API keys, or tokens in source control

## Documentation

- Public APIs must be documented
- Breaking changes require migration notes
- README kept up to date with setup instructions
- CHANGELOG maintained for releases
